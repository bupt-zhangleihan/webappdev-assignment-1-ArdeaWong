    <p class="sonnet-text" style="display: none;">
        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
        Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
        And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br>
        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
        And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
        By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;<br>
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade<br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;<br>
        Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade,<br>
        When in eternal lines to time thou growest:<br>
        So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
        So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
